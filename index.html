    <h1>Code Challenge Project Not Waste</h1>
    <h2>Problem #1: <br/>
        Provide some Python code that can be used to measure how long a function takes to run in a friendly
        format. The amount of time can range from less than a second to several hours and should be easy
        for a human to read (for example “00:00:00:00012” is not a good output).</h2>
        <h2 style="color:red;">This is my solution using plain Javascript and HTML. Yep! my first attempt was doing it with JS, after that, I went with python.</h2>
        <label >Observation: Just change the value of the input. A value of 50000 in my laptop runs in 11 seconds, but a value of 200000 can take up to 3 minutes (2 mins 47 seconds to be precise).</label><br>
        <input type="number" name="a" id="a" placeholder="Write a number">
    <button onclick="timeMeter(functionToMeasure)">Click to run the function</button> <br>
    <p id="timeShow"></p>
    <p id="timeShow2"></p>

    <h4>I show the elapsed time in two different formats. The code comments are inside de JS file</h4>
    <h4>Checkout the browser console.</h4>
